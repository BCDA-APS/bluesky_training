Instrument
==========

The instrument package defines the features of your equipment for use with data
acquisition using the Bluesky framework.  It is structured as a Python package
[#package]_ so that it will be easy to use with the Python ``import`` command,
like much other Python software.

There are many ways to define your equipment so consider this guide as a
reference for ideas rather than a set of requirements.
