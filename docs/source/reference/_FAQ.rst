3. In python, what are classes, objects, methods and instances??

    - A **class** is like a blueprint or a template that defines the characteristics and behaviors of a particular type of object. For example, we can define a `Dog` class that includes attributes such as breed, age, and name, as well as behaviors such as barking and wagging its tail.
    - An **object** is an **instance** of a class. So, if we have a `Dog` class, we can create objects of that class, such as "Fido" and "Buddy". Each object of the `Dog` class will have its own set of **attributes**, such as "Fido" being a Golden Retriever and "Buddy" being a Chihuahua, and **methods**, such as "Fido" barking loudly and "Buddy" wagging its tail.
    - An **instance** is a specific occurrence of an **object** created from a **class**. For example, with our `Dog` class, we can create an instance of that class called "my_dog" with specific attributes and behaviors.
    - A **method** is a function that is defined in a **class** and can be called on an **object** of that class. For example, the "bark" method defined in the `Dog` class can be called on the object "my_dog" to make it bark.
