    "\n",
    "A _PID_ loop (see below) has been [paired](https://github.com/epics-modules/optics/blob/master/opticsApp/Db/fb_epid.db) with the simulated temperature using the synApps [`epid`](https://epics.anl.gov/bcda/synApps/std/epidRecord.html) record, to update the operating power of the heater so that the temperature reaches a desired value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Significant _additional_ **realism is added to the simulation** by switching to the synApps [`transform`](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epics-modules/calc/R3-6-1/documentation/transformRecord.html) record.  The `transform` record also has 16 fields for values plus additional features:\n",

    "- (optional) input PV link (same as `swait` record)\n",
    "- (optional) calculation expression\n",
    "- (optional) output PV link\n",
    "- (optional) descriptive text comment\n",
    "\n",
    "Replacing `swait` with `transform` allows the addition of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a random noise simulation\n",
    "- a `tolerance` value for evaluating if the setpoint and readback are in agreement\n",
    "- an _at temperature_ feature\n",
    "\n",
    "## Schematic\n",
    "The PID loop decreases the difference (the _following error_) between the current temperature (readback) and a given setpoint by controlling the heater's power:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "power_fraction --> temperature --> PID --> output\n",
    "  ^                                          |\n",
    "  |                                          v\n",
    "   <-----------------------------------------\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulated temperature signal is computed from the various inputs of the `transform` record.  The computation follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$T_{sim} = T_{last} + \\Delta T_{cool} + \\Delta T_{heat} + \\Delta T_{noise}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain fields of this `transform` record are linked to fields in an `epid` record.  When the `transform` record is [evaluated](https://docs.epics-controls.org/en/latest/guides/EPICS_Process_Database_Concepts.html) (_processed_, in EPICS terms), the `epid` is then _processed_.  The `epid` record computes a new value (of _power_fraction_, the fraction of total heater power) for the next computation of the temperature signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulated temperature is re-computed (processed) [periodically](https://docs.epics-controls.org/en/latest/guides/EPICS_Process_Database_Concepts.html#scanning-specification), as configured by the `transform` record's [`.SCAN`](https://docs.epics-controls.org/en/latest/guides/EPICS_Process_Database_Concepts.html?highlight=.SCAN#periodic-scanning) field.\n",
    "When `transform` is processed, it first pulls the _power_fraction_ from `epid` (the output of the PID loop calculation) for the next simulated temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once `transform` processing is complete, the `epid` record is told to process itself by configuring the `transform` record's [forward link](https://docs.epics-controls.org/en/latest/guides/EPICS_Process_Database_Concepts.html#forward-links) (.`FLNK`) field.  The _setpoint_ is pushed from `transform` to `epid`_ while `epid` pulls the current _temperature_ (readback) from `transform`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the simulated heater, the temperature calculation includes a simulation of cooling.  This cooling is computed as a fraction of the last simulated temperature.  Without any applied heating (when the heater power is OFF), the simulated will progress to the minimum temperature.  (This simulation is a _heater_ where the simulated temperature is constrained by `T_min <= T <= T_max`.)\n",
